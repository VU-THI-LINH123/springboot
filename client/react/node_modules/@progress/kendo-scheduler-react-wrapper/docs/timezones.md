# Timezones

A [timezone](http://www.timeanddate.com/time/time-zones.html) refers to any of the 24 regions loosely divided by longitude, where the same standard time is kept.

## Basic Concepts

In JavaScript, the `Date` object represents a single moment in time that is measured in the number of milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. The `Date` objects are [always created by using the current browser timezone offset](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-localtime).

To construct a new `Date` object, use the `new Date(2014,1,1,12,0,0);` configuration. The `Sat Feb 01 2014 12:00:00 GMT+0200 (FLE Standard Time)` result in the browser console shows that the current timezone offset is already applied.

When you try to convert the previously created JavaScript `Date` to a JSON string by using the [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method, you get the `""2014-02-01T10:00:00.000Z""` result.

## Configuration

You can define a [`timezone`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/scheduler#configuration-timezone) option to the Scheduler. The timezone indicates to the component what timezone to apply when it displays the appointment dates.

By default, the `timezone` option is not set and the [event dates will be created based on the current client timezone offset](#configuration-Scheduler). This means that users from different timezones will see different start and end times. On the other hand, setting the Scheduler [`timezone`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/scheduler#configuration-timezone) will force the component to show the same start and end times regardless of the user's timezone.

Based on the specifics of the JavaScript `Date` object and to read and send the dates of the event, the Scheduler requires you to adjust them.

> * When you use remote binding, the Scheduler expects to receive UTC dates. Respectively, it will send them back to the server in UTC. The service in use is responsible for keeping the dates in a UTC format without offsetting them against its local time.
> * When you bind the Scheduler to a remote data service, keep the `timezone` option always set to `"Etc"` or `"UTC"`.
> * When the `timezone` option of the Scheduler is not set, the timezone offset of the current system is used.
> * The recommended `Date` format for sending and receiving Scheduler event dates is [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) with a **Z** zone designator (UTC date). The same format is used by the [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method, which converts JavaScript `Date` objects to JSON strings.

### Reading Events from the Data Source

The [`SchedulerEvent`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/schedulerevent) instances are created where the start and end dates are instantiated as JavaScript `Date` objects. During the process, the [dates will be offset against the local time](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-localtime).

If the [`timezone`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/scheduler#configuration-timezone) option is defined, the component removes the local timezone offset, converting dates to UTC. Then, it applies the defined timezone value&mdash;for example, `America/New_York`.

### Sending Events to the Remote Service

If the [`timezone`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/ui/scheduler#configuration-timezone) option is defined, the component removes the applied timezone offset&mdash;for example, `America/New_York`, converting dates to UTC. Then, it applies the local time.

The [`SchedulerEvent`](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/api/javascript/data/schedulerevent) instances are serialized by using the [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method. In the process, the dates are converted to UTC and then formatted according to the [ISO8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601).

### Setting the No-Timezone Option

If you choose to not define a timezone option, your system timezone settings will apply by default. You can customize them to deliver an appointment date either in the local offset or in UTC.

The following example demonstrates a Scheduler which shows the dates in the local timezone offset&mdash;the event is displayed as scheduled for 2:00pm, regardless of your location (whether you are in the `Europe/Berlin` or in the `Europe/Sofia` timezone).

{% meta height:660 %}
```jsx-preview
class SchedulerContainer extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.date = new Date("2013/6/13");
        this.dataSource = [
            {
                title: "The Internship",
                imdb: "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234155/",
                start: new Date("2013/6/13 14:00"),
                end: new Date("2013/6/13 15:30")
            }
        ];
        this.startTime = new Date("2013/6/13 10:00");
        this.endTime = new Date("2013/6/13 23:00");
        this.views = ["day"]

    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Scheduler date={this.date}
                    startTime={this.startTime}
                    endTime={this.endTime}
                    views={this.views}
                    editable={false}
                    height={600}
                    dataSource={this.dataSource}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <SchedulerContainer/>,
    document.querySelector('my-app')
);
```
{% endmeta %}

The following example demonstrates a Scheduler which shows the dates according to the UTC convention. This means that the event is displayed as scheduled for 4:00pm if you are in the `Europe/Berlin` timezone while if you are in the `Europe/Sofia` timezone, the event appears as scheduled for 5:00pm.  

> When you use formats for parsing UTC date strings and to render the local time, [apply the `zzz` specifier](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/framework/globalization/dateparsing). Otherwise, the browser applies its current timezone.

```jsx
class SchedulerContainer extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.date = new Date("2013/6/13");
        this.dataSource = [
            {
                title: "The Internship",
                imdb: "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234155/",
                start: new Date("2013-06-13T14:00:00.000Z"),
                end: new Date("2013-06-13T15:30:00.000Z")
            }
        ];
        this.startTime = new Date("2013/6/13 10:00");
        this.endTime = new Date("2013/6/13 23:00");
        this.views = ["day"]

    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Scheduler date={this.date}
                    startTime={this.startTime}
                    endTime={this.endTime}
                    views={this.views}
                    editable={false}
                    height={600}
                    dataSource={this.dataSource}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <SchedulerContainer/>,
    document.querySelector('my-app')
);
```
