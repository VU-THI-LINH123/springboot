# Resources

The Scheduler allows you to assign events to a set of predefined resources.

You can assign multiple instances of the same resource type to a single Scheduler event. The Scheduler also enables you to assign resources through its event edit form.

## Resource Instances

The available resource instances are:
* [Single-instance resources](#toc-single-instance-resources)
* [Multiple-instance resources](#toc-multiple-instance-resources)

### Single-Instance Resources

A single instance resource is a resource of which only one instance can be assigned to a Scheduler event. A typical example is a Scheduler displaying a list of meetings (Scheduler events), which are held in two rooms (resources). Since a meeting can be held in one room it can be considered a single resource. If a resource instance has its `color` field set, the Scheduler will use this value as background for all events assigned to that instance.

```jsx-preview
class SchedulerContainer extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.date = new Date("2013/6/6");
        this.events = this.props.events;
        this.resources = [
            {
                field: "roomId", // The field of the Scheduler event which contains the resource identifier.
                title: "Room", // The label displayed in the Scheduler edit form for this resource.
                dataSource: [
                    {
                        text: "Meeting Room 101", // Text of the resource instance
                        value: 1, // The identifier of the resource instance. Use that value to assign an event to this instance.
                        color: "#1c9ec4" // Used as the background of events assigned to this resource.
                    },
                    { text: "Meeting Room 102", value: 2, color: "#ff7663" }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Scheduler height={600}
                    dataSource={this.events}
                    date={this.date}
                    resources={this.resources}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <SchedulerContainer events={[{id: 1, start: new Date("2013/6/6 08:00 AM"), end: new Date("2013/6/6 09:00 AM"),title: "Breakfast", roomId: 1},
        {id: 2,start: new Date("2013/6/6 10:15 AM"),end: new Date("2013/6/6 12:30 PM"),title: "Job Interview",roomId: 2}]}/>,
    document.querySelector('my-app')
);
```
{% endmeta %}

### Multiple-Instance Resources

Multiple instance resources are the resources to which allow the assigning of more than one instance to a Scheduler event&mdash;for example, a Scheduler which displays a list of meetings and the meeting attendees. Because more than one attendee can participate in a meeting, it represents a multiple-instance resource. The Scheduler uses the `color` of the first resource instance as a background for all its events.

```jsx
class SchedulerContainer extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.date = new Date("2013/6/6");
        this.events = this.props.events;
        this.resources = [
            {
                field: "attendees", // The field of the Scheduler event which contains the resource identifier.
                title: "Attendees", // The label displayed in the Scheduler edit form for this resource.
                dataSource: [
                    {
                        text: "Alex", // Text of the resource instance.
                        value: 1, // The identifier of the resource instance. Use that value to assign an event to this instance.
                        color: "#ef701d" // Used as the background of events assigned to this resource.
                    },
                    { text: "Bob", value: 2, color: "#5fb1f7" },
                    { text: "Charlie", value: 3, color: "#35a964" }
                ],
                multiple: true // Indicate that this is a multiple instance resource.
            }
        ]
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Scheduler height={600}
                    dataSource={this.events}
                    date={this.date}
                    resources={this.resources}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <SchedulerContainer events={[{id: 1, start: new Date("2013/6/6 08:00 AM"), end: new Date("2013/6/6 09:00 AM"),title: "Breakfast", attendees: [2, 3]},
        {id: 2,start: new Date("2013/6/6 10:15 AM"),end: new Date("2013/6/6 12:30 PM"),title: "Job Interview", attendees: [1, 2] }]}/>,
    document.querySelector('my-app')
);
```

## Combining Resources

The Scheduler supports unlimited resource types&mdash;for example, you can combine the single and multiple resource instances from the previous examples in one.

```jsx
class SchedulerContainer extends React.Component {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.date = new Date("2013/6/6");
        this.events = this.props.events;
        this.resources = [
            // First resource type definition
            {
                field: "roomId", // The field of the Scheduler event which contains the resource identifier.
                title: "Room", // The label displayed in the Scheduler edit form for this resource.
                dataSource: [
                    {
                        text: "Meeting Room 101", // The text of the resource instance.
                        value: 1, // The identifier of the resource instance. Use that value to assign an event to this instance.
                        color: "#1c9ec4" // Used as the background of events assigned to this resource.
                    },
                    { text: "Meeting Room 102", value: 2, color: "#ff7663" }
                ]
            },
    // Second resource type definition
            {
                field: "attendees", // The field of the Scheduler event which contains the resource identifier
                title: "Attendees", // The label displayed in the Scheduler edit form for this resource
                    dataSource: [
                        {
                            text: "Alex", // The text of the resource instance.
                            value: 1, // The identifier of the resource instance. Use that value to assign an event to this instance.
                            color: "#ef701d" // Used as the background of events assigned to this resource.
                        },
                        { text: "Bob", value: 2, color: "#5fb1f7" },
                        { text: "Charlie", value: 3, color: "#35a964" }
                    ],
            multiple: true // Indicate that this is a multiple instance resource.
            }
        ]
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <Scheduler height={600}
                    dataSource={this.events}
                    date={this.date}
                    resources={this.resources}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
ReactDOM.render(
    <SchedulerContainer events={[{id: 1, start: new Date("2013/6/6 08:00 AM"),end: new Date("2013/6/6 09:00 AM"),title: "Breakfast", attendees: [2, 3], roomId: 1},
        {id: 2,start: new Date("2013/6/6 10:15 AM"),end: new Date("2013/6/6 12:30 PM"),title: "Job Interview", attendees: [1, 2], roomId: 2 }]}/>,
    document.querySelector('my-app')
);
```
