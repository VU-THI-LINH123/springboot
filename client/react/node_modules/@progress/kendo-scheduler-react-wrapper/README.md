# Looking for a Professional-Grade React UI Component?

If you are searching for a native React UI component (no jQuery dependency), please visit the [KendoReact Scheduler](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/scheduler/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-scheduler-wrapper&utm_content=description), which has replaced the initial jQuery implementation available in this package. 

KendoReact is a suite of 60+ UI and DataViz components designed and built from the ground up for React: everything from Grid and Charts to DatePicker, DropDowns and Buttons, complete with themes and ready to use out-of-the-box.

# About this package

At this time, most of the UI components in Kendo UI for jQuery (including this one) have their native React equivalents, available as part of the [KendoReact UI library](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-scheduler-wrapper&utm_content=description). For those few that are not yet available, you can utilize the jQuery equivalent in your React applications following [these instructions](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/third-party/react?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=npm&utm_campaign=kendo-ui-react-trial-npm-scheduler-wrapper&utm_content=description).
